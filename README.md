The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how data can be pulled from an ILA logic analyzer in Vivado and become available for use in Matlab.

Here, a stream of 64-bit words is obtained from an ILA, where each word is 2 16-bit I/Q sample pairs. All of the I samples are pulled into Matlab and are avilable for analysis.
